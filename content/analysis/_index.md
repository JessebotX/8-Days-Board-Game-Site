# Quantitative Analysis

# Typical Play Session
The game should average anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours for 4 players, with the shortest being everyone just dying off the beginning of the game. A day in the game would take anywhere from 5-10 minutes, as the players get more experienced they have to make more calculative decisions. As the name of the game states there are only 8 days(32 turns if there are 4 players) in the entire game, thus indicating how the playtime of the game has the potential of either being super short or going the full distance, as we have balanced the game to force users to be more careful with their decision-making.
