# Quantitative Analysis

Weapons expected values
Weapons expected damage (weighted average over probabilities) in 1 hit:

Unarmed: 2.9

Knife: 3.4

Torch: 2.9

Spear: 4.1
 
Axe: 4.1

Bow and Arrow: 4.4

Pistol: 4.4

Revolver: 4.7

Sniper Rifle: 5.3
Assault Rifle: 4.8 expected value
As you can see, torch is pretty much useless as it’s expected value is the same as unarmed. However, it has better probabilities, so it might “feel” better in hands of a lucky player. Further, we believe that this game should be extremely hard to be “beat” after the first playthrough, so we wanted to introduce some bad choices so players have room to make mistakes. 

All hostile NPCs have 10 health, so we expect one player to require 10/2.9 = 3-4 turns to beat it. This means players should try to work together to fight monsters at early stages, as being left with 2-4 health after the first encounter almost certainly means this player would not survive until the end.

Tiles:
There is the same number of tiles of each type, so on average a tile would have +1 resource modifier. With the 0-2 spread, however, players will need to decide whether it is worth it to fight on a +0 tile and choose their paths more carefully. Further players would need to think more about what tile they want to finish their turn on on Days 2, 4, 6 as that’s when there is a high chance of being attacked, and one would want that inevitable fight to happen on a tile with better outcome.

Tile events:
Hostile Encounters on Cards [40%]
Zombie [30%]
10 Health
Damage: 2
Monsters can have 0-2 resource, specified on card
Hostile NPC [10%]
10 Health
Damage: 4
Hostile NPC can have 1-3 resource
Trader [20%]
Resource [30%]
Nothing [10%]

We decided to set hostile encounters to 40% probability. On average we expect the encounter to last 2-3 turns, so a player would take 4-6 dmg vs zombie, 8-12 vs hostile npc. 
Players would not be able to survive if they have to fight every turn, and the hostile NPC should only be fought as a group and as a last resort.
Every 2 days, there is a 30% chance that a monster spawns at player location.
On average, there are 4 times as many resources than weapons.

# Typical Play Session
The game should average anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours for 4 players, with the shortest being everyone just dying off the beginning of the game. A day in the game would take anywhere from 5-10 minutes, as the players get more experienced they have to make more calculative decisions. As the name of the game states there are only 8 days(32 turns if there are 4 players) in the entire game, thus indicating how the playtime of the game has the potential of either being super short or going the full distance, as we have balanced the game to force users to be more careful with their decision-making.
