title: Tradeoffs/Dilemmas/Dynamics
---

# Dynamics
* Not looking around if you are the last player during a turn before the
  day ends on every other day(2,4,6) so you don’t gamble the chance of
  potentially fighting monsters twice
* Saving your scraps so when the first player gets a ranged weapon you
  can craft ammo and work together to fend off potential hostile mobs.
* Having four players roll on the the same tile for a tile event to
  potentially fight a mob and get resources early and to decrease the
  amount of health lost by a single player
* Using a juggernaut strategy by just funneling one player with all the
  resources and crafting them an early weapon
* Managing their health and hunger as it’s not guaranteed you will come
  by resources that will help regenerate them.

# Dilemmas/Tradeoffs
* **Full inventory**: choosing to discard an item when you have a full
  inventory to pick up potentially more valuable resources in the
  moment, ex; discarding extra food for scrap/cloth/wood to craft
  things.
* **Traveling together**: You won’t be punished however your progress
  may be slower as you are clearing less of the map, and you won’t get
  as many resources due to the resources gained for discovering
  tiles. However, you get to fight monsters together giving a higher
  survival rate, and be able to work together to ration hunger.
* **Traveling alone**: You acquire more resources in the fact that you
  are the ones discovering the tiles, however you run into the risk
  factor that if you are unable to escape from a monster you have to
  fight that monster by yourself.
* **Choosing not to look around**: Avoiding the chance that you may run
  into a hostile mob and playing the safe game by trying to meet up with
  another player to recover health, or to tackle mobs together.
* **Choosing to look around**: In the scenario that the player has
  higher health but lower hunger they can choose to stay on the same
  tile but look around, in the potential scenario that they may find
  food or stall for time for another player to travel to them with food,
  as moving to different tiles will consume hunger which will also
  result in the player dying.
* **Deciding to run from a monster or to fight it**: You could gain
  rewards such as resources, or a potential weapon that will help you in
  the long run, however you would be lower in health therefore having a
  higher risk of losing the game.
* **Crafting a weapon with resources**: Potential advantage as you may
  never be lucky enough to find a weapon, however you use expensive
  resources that could benefit you in the scenario you do find a weapon
  ex; using scrap to craft ammo instead of a knife if you find a rifle.
* **Sharing resources with other players**: allowing you to acquire what
  you need in the moment, however could be the reason for your downfall
  if you trade resources you suddenly need for ex; unable to find hunger
  and you traded your food away
