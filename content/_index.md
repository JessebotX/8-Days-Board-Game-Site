# Background
The city of Delray was blossoming as the summer was peaking and families were enjoying the regular day as always. Until a sudden afternoon, when the city of Delray experienced something no one has ever experienced. The City of Delray lies in southwest territories close to the borders of Surelta, a city where all the scientists reside to research inhuman origins such as Zombies and aliens that might one day possess a threat to humanity. 

Researchers of Surelta were making an antidote for zombie attacks which was leaked a couple of days back and people of Surelta started having side effects of it. These side effects were minor resulting in skin allergies or pneumonia. Though there was one exception, a case in which an adult male affected by the leak was seen showing traits of a zombie in which he attacked humans and also caused destruction. Delray was unaware that they could be a target of such a leak and the worst just happened. The human which turned into a zombie was now attacking multiple other human beings who started to get into the same phase and suddenly a normal afternoon Delray saw the attack on their humankind. More than 90 zombies from Surelta were released and sent to Delray. These attacked all the households and not only were against human lives but also lead to city destruction causing multiple wore and torn municipalities. Even the hospital staff was attacked leading to no protection and cure for affected humans. 

Due to Delray’s far South location, it was divided by multiple water bodies and rescue from large countries was far far away. The way to pull out of this attack was a special weapon attack on zombies which killed them right away. Countries in the Northeast had such weapons and it will take 8 days for them to reach Delray.

The journey won’t be easy it can lead to anything we don’t know how many zombies are out there and what strengths they hold the only chance of saving is to protect yourself for the next 8 days until rescue arrives. The question is, “Do you have what it takes”?
