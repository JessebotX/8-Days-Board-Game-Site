# Playtesting
## Playtesting Log 1
* Initial playtest of the game showed that the scope of the project was
  too large and that reworks in certain mechanics were necessary
* Ranged combat mechanic had been reworked as it was too
  complex. Initially, we decided that the monster would always attack
  first, unless the player had a ranged weapon, in which then they could
  use it before the fight begun, but you can only use ranged weapons
  once. This additional mechanic has been scrapped.
* Even though the game is supposed to be very hard, it was too hard
  because we constantly lose hunger and health from encounters very
  quickly, yet obtaining resources to replenish said health and hunger
  were nearly impossible due to the odds
* Each player now starts with 1 bandage item and 1 food item
* Hunger no longer drops when you decide to stay on a tile without
  moving; you only lose hunger when you decide to move.
* Max hunger points capped at 5 instead of 10 and initial hunger starts
  at 3 instead of 6 to compensate for hunger changes
* Redefined the meaning of day and turn
  * 1 Turn = 1 Player making their actions
  * 1 Day = After everyone has gone their turn and now its the turn of
    the person that made the first turn
* Added new mechanic: after every day, monsters spawn; this is to
  encourage players to not camp a tile
* Reworked combat damage: all weapons can deal 3 types of damage: bad,
  base, or crit. Roll dice to figure out which type of attack to deal
* Added hostile NPC
* Added trader NPC

## Playtesting Log 2
* Second playtest was a significant improvement to the first as
  everything went smoother, the game was more fun and many changes done
  in playtesting 1 had simplified a lot of complexity, such as the
  ranged weapon mechanic
* Night time zombie spawning mechanic essentially encouraged the last
  player to not "look around" their tile since there is a high chance a
  monster will spawn and they would have to fight monsters back to back,
  so we made it so that night time zombies ONLY spawn on Day 2, 4 and 6
* Normalized all odds that were multiples of 5 to be multiples of 10, in
  consideration of the 10 sided die that will be used
* Included snowstorm mechanic in order to force players off of a tile
  (prevent camping and encourage moving)
* Reduced board size to 6 wide and 6 tall
